## About
This repository contains the source code for a Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Dashboard built with Streamlit. The application provides an interactive, real-time overview of clinical trial performance metrics, allowing users to track patient progress, data discrepancies, and query resolution efficiency across multiple trial sites.

## Introduction
The Clinical Trial Data Monitoring Dashboard is designed to help clinical research associates (CRAs), data managers, and trial coordinators gain insights into trial data integrity, completeness, and quality. The dashboard enables efficient tracking of data cleaning status, case report form (CRF) completion, query management, and serious adverse event (SAE) reconciliation to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

ðŸ“Œ DISCLAIMER: THIS DASHBOARD IS BASED ON SYNTHETIC OR ANONYMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL DATA AND IS INTENDED FOR DEMONSTRATION AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

## Features
-Patient Tracking & Enrollment Status:
View trial participants' screening, enrollment, treatment, and follow-up progress across different regions.

-Query Management Overview:
Monitor open, answered, and closed queries to track data resolution progress.

-Data Cleaning & Readiness for Lock:
Identify subjects ready for database lock, subjects with missing forms, and unresolved data discrepancies.

-SAE & Third-Party Vendor Data Reconciliation:
Ensure consistency between safety reports, vendor data, and electronic data capture (EDC) records.

Real-Time Data Visualization:
Interactive charts and tables to quickly analyze study performance and compliance.
